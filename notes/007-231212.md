# Must know equations, knowledge
- V = IR
  - 5V, 2 * 250 Ohm, 10mA
    - when you measure between resistors, each one is 2.5V = 250 * 0.01A
    - P = 2.5V * 0.25A = 0.625W consumed in between
- P (Watts) = VI = I * R * I = I^2 * R
  - I^2 = heat in calories
- 1 마력 ~= 745 W
- 전압은 병렬로 측정한다

# Electronics
- BJT -> Mosfet transistors have faster switching time
- Relays have transistors in it. Made for easier setup.
