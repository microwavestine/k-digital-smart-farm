- t_on means how long it takes for capacitor to charge up from 1/3VDD to 2/3VDD
- t_off means the same except it's for discharge

## As an oscillator (astable mode)
- 1n4148 diode 사용
- 정류형 다이오드 Rectifier diode (검은색 다이오드) 는 너무 느림

  - Rectifier diodes are used for low-frequency applications below 500 Hz, whereas FRDs are used for high-frequency switching from a few kHz to 100 kHz.

- capacitor charge rate can be changed by adjusting r1, r2 resistors (the resistors that go through capacitor charge/discharge operations)
- can check with oscillatorscope on the output (3rd) pin that increasing or decreasing resistor values either makes LOW frequency longer or HIGH frequency longer
