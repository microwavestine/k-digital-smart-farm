# When to pull up LEDs
- certain boards with high output resistance may not be able to supply enough voltage to turn on LEDs
- Hook up LED to VCC and invert the signal so the LED turns on when it's 0, and off when it's 1.

# ULN2300
Circuits with coils i.e relay require diode to prevent wrong flow of current. ICs such as ULN2300 are often used with relays so have diodes built in to them.
