# SPI, I2C and EPROM
## How are I2C and SPI protocols used with EPROM?
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) are communication protocols commonly used to interface with EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), including EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory). While EPROM itself is not electrically erasable, the principles of communication with I2C and SPI remain similar when working with EEPROM.

1. **I2C Protocol:**
   - I2C is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave, and serial communication protocol.
   - EPROMs or EEPROMs with I2C interfaces typically have a specific I2C address.
   - The communication involves a master device (e.g., microcontroller) and one or more slave devices (EPROMs or EEPROMs).
   - Communication on the I2C bus occurs through two wires: SDA (data line) and SCL (clock line).
   - To read from or write to an EPROM using I2C:
      - The master sends a start condition on the bus.
      - The master sends the 7-bit device address of the EPROM followed by a bit indicating whether it wants to read or write.
      - The EPROM acknowledges the address.
      - For writing, the master sends the data to be written, and for reading, the master reads the data sent by the EPROM.
      - The communication ends with a stop condition.

2. **SPI Protocol:**
   - SPI is a synchronous, full-duplex, and serial communication protocol.
   - EPROMs or EEPROMs with SPI interfaces typically have multiple pins, including Serial Clock (SCK), Master Out Slave In (MOSI), Master In Slave Out (MISO), and Chip Select (CS).
   - The communication typically involves a master device (e.g., microcontroller) and one or more slave devices (EPROMs or EEPROMs).
   - To read from or write to an EPROM using SPI:
      - The master selects the specific EPROM by activating its chip select (CS) line.
      - The master sends clock pulses (SCK) to synchronize the communication.
      - For writing, the master sends data on the MOSI line, and for reading, it reads data from the MISO line.
      - The EPROM responds accordingly, and the communication is typically full-duplex.
      - The master deactivates the chip select (CS) line to end the communication.

When using these protocols with EPROMs, it's essential to consult the datasheets of both the EPROM and the microcontroller to ensure compatibility and proper configuration of timing, addressing, and other parameters. The choice between I2C and SPI may depend on factors such as the specific requirements of the application and the capabilities of the devices being used.
