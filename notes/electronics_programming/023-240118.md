# MC14051
- Analog switch (de)multiplexer
- can send to and receive inputs from output
- ON Resistance (R_on) 가 200 ohm 일 경우 부하가 2k W 이상이어야함
  - 작을수록 비쌈
- Also LGS GD4051B

# DHT Sensor
- Why do we add pull up resistor to the output?
  - To increase the speed of voltage reaching the peak
  - pull up resistors also prevents chattering effect when there's floating state
