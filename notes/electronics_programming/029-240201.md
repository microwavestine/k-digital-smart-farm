# JFET
- 트랜지스터가 들어간 OP AMP 일 경우
  - R = R1 // R2 병렬저항

# Voltage Follow circuit with Op Amp
- acts as a buffer
- to amplify signals that are weak to match input and output
- 1+ R1/R2 where R2 is near infinite and R1 is 0, so the amplification index is 1.

## Non inverting vs voltage follower circuit
Yes, a non-inverting amplifier circuit and a voltage follower (buffer) circuit are different configurations.

1. **Non-Inverting Amplifier:**
   - In a non-inverting amplifier circuit, the input signal is applied to the non-inverting terminal of the operational amplifier.
   - The output signal is an amplified version of the input signal, and the amplification factor is determined by external resistors in the circuit.
   - The voltage at the output is in-phase with the input signal.

2. **Voltage Follower (Buffer) Circuit:**
   - In a voltage follower circuit, the input signal is connected to the non-inverting terminal of the operational amplifier.
   - The key characteristic of a voltage follower is that it provides unity gain, meaning the output voltage closely follows the input voltage.
   - It has a high input impedance and a low output impedance, making it useful for isolating the input and output of a circuit.

In summary, while both circuits utilize the non-inverting terminal of the operational amplifier, the non-inverting amplifier is designed to provide signal amplification, while the voltage follower (buffer) circuit is designed to maintain the same voltage as the input with a high input impedance and low output impedance.
