# Basic Knowledge
- \r\n = CRLF = 0D0A
	- Carriage Return; returns cursor to front then move to new line
	- 0x0D 0x0A is often seen in networking at end of packet etc
- In C switch statements, numbers are accepted for parameters by standard because it's a primitive value and string is a (array) class in C.
- Any values beside 0 is treated as true in C.
- Bipolar junction transistor is the first transistor and made with Gallium
- further developed into (MOS)FET (field effect transistor) with n and p channels.

# 논리 회로
- Quad NAND/NOR/AND... Gate = 4 logics in one chip
- XOR = 1 & 0 = true. 1 & 1 or 0 & 0 is false.
- 74hc00 (high speed cmos) vs tcd 100 ls (transistor)
