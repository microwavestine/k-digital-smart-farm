# 010-231215: Potentiometers

## Potentiometers
- changes resistance by dial
- inside potentiometers are thin strip of metal attached by another metal
- the thin strip works as 10k Ohm resistor when flattened
- the other metal moves along the resistor
- The first half of thin metal vs the second half of thin metal voltage is calculated
  - R1 / R1+R2 * V
  - R2 / R1+R2 * V

- therefore as the dial changes, the voltages changes
